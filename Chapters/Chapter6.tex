One class SVM when predicting on the whole dataset visually mispredicted a lot of pixels, this might be due to choosing non-optimal parameters or due to not scaling the data attributes. More optimal parameters can be found. Scaling can improve the accuracy significantly if properly done. Possibility of developing unsupervised classification algorithms based on stokes parameter can be investigated in the future. Image classification methods using Deep Neural Networks in SAR data have surfaced and can be investigated in the future.
