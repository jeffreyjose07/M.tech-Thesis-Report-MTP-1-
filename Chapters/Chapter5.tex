The utilization of features such as Stokes parameter were helpful in detecting forest area in the given dataset. Comparatively, classification with m-$\delta$ values as the feature showed lesser accuracy than when classification is done with stokes parameter as the feature. Maximum Likelihood Classifier requires atleast two classes to work and hence required us to manually label non-forest area, One Class SVM doesn't require negative instances and can hence remove this difficulty.
